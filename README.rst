Upgrade from 1.X
----------------

Note: for those who came from 1.X this addon dont provide UX anymore.
This addon is now intended to integrator.
Please consider use collective.galleria as a great gallery viewer for Plone.

Note that Galleriffic is not maintained. This is one of the reason why I have
removed UX from this package. jQuery gallery appear and disapear every day.

To cleanup you plonesite from 1.X, you can call @@collective.gallery.zclean as
administrator or use the profile 'zclean' which remove galleriffic from your
javascript registry.

Components (Backend)
====================

Summary:

* No custom content type, only views
* Works with lots of photos (is developed to work with +300 photos)
* Ramcache setup with a default key to one hours + modification date
* Works with Folder, Topic and Link content types
* picasaweb_ and flickr_ support.
* facebook support.
* I18N: english, french, german and italian are available

collective.gallery use zope.components to provide as much reusable components
as possible.

First we have photo resources. Plone already manage this for you:

* Folder can contains Image
* Topic can be criterized to list only Image content type
* Link can be sources of photos throw picasaweb.google.com and flickr.com services.

Next you have the main component: IGallery.
This interface is implemented at two levels:

* As named adapter over IATLink to get photos from picasaweb or flickr or facebook.
* As browserview to control the resource (@@gallery)

Folder & Image
--------------

Folder and Image content type can be used to build a gallery. Add a folder and
then add every images in it. Once its done come up to the folder and choose
'Gallery view' in the display drop down menu and voila.

The folder gallery component query the portal_catalog and adapts brains to
IPhoto.

Topic & Image
-------------

Topic can be used to build a gallery. Add a topic and add criteria on the Type
to select only Image. Next choose the 'Gallery view' in the drop down menu and
voila.

The topic gallery component use the topic's queryCatalog method to get brains,
then they are adapted to IPhoto

Link
----

Link can be used to build a gallery. Add a link, set URL to one of the following
services, validate and choose the 'Gallery view' in the drop down menu and
voila.

The link gallery component get all named adapters from Link to IGallery and call
the validate method. The first validated adapter is kept as resources.
